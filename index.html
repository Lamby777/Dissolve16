		// How it works: Tiles spawn at 16. When 2 collide,
		the smaller is subtracted from the larger one. If the
		result is a negative number, it loops back around to
		16 and the absolute value is subtracted from 16. New
		squares spawn every 6 moves. Your goal is to "dissolve"
		all the squares on the screen by scoring 0s in the
		least possible moves.
